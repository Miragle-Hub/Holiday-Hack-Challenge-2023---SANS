### Snowball Fight
Difficulty: ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„

Visit Christmas Island and talk to Morcel Nougat about this great new game. Team up with another player and show Morcel how to win against Santa!

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
To win the game we have to defeat elves and the Santa but boy is it difficult. As the hint says we need a powerful player to team with us and defeat elves and santa, that would be the Dwarf. Hint is in the Javascript source code of the game as highlighted below.

### Code Analysis:
The code appears to introduce a character (Elf the dwarf, jokingly referred to as Jared) into the game when in single-player mode.First, a sound effect named 'elf_the_dwarf_is_here' is played if audio is enabled. Next, a toast message appears on the screen saying "Elf the dwarf has joined your team!" for a short duration. Finally, a new game sprite named 'jaredSprite' is created at a specific position. All indicating we need the Dwarf.

```
 // Check if it's single-player mode
    // jared ... I mean Elf the dwarf joins the fight when in single player mode
       if (singlePlayer === 'true') {
          setTimeout(() => {
            if (isaudio) {
              gameSceneObject.sound.play('elf_the_dwarf_is_here', { volume: 0.5 });
            }
            toastManager.showToast("Elf the dwarf has joined your team!", duration=500, delay=5000);
            jaredSprite = gameSceneObject.physics.add.sprite(starting_pos.x + 150, starting_pos.y, 'jaredSprite');
```
### Working towards Victory: 
We have to change singlePlayer parameter to true and reload game. 
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not play this game in a seperate tab or windows of your browser you have to complete this challenge in the same page with the help of developer tools console.

##### Steps:
1. Open Developer console and change the frame to the game room
   
<img width="241" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Miragle-Hub/Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023---SANS/assets/128744976/634c5fa8-78d0-4b6b-9a04-d4b4a50280cd">

2. Choose play game with random players and once the game room to loads check the current loaded URL "window.location.href"
   
3. Use the below javascript which changes the "SinglePlayer" parameter to true and loads the frame again.
  
4. Now you have Dwarf the elf on your team. Playing the game is made easier.

````
// Get the current URL
var url = new URL(window.location.href);

// Update the 'singlePlayer' parameter to 'true'
url.searchParams.set('singlePlayer', 'true');

// Reload the frame with the modified URL
window.location.href = url.href;

## Christmas Island: Rudolph's Resort
### Reportinator
Difficulty: ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
Noel Boetie used ChatNPT to write a pentest report. Go to Christmas Island and help him clean it up.
Reportinator

We are presented with a report to check if the vulnerabilities reported are true or false.
It is good to read through the report and get your answers but there is also an alternative way to do this challenege.

### Technique
There is a POST request with payload data for the 9 questions asked where 1 indicates false and 0 indicates true. With the help of Burpsuite we will first intercept the request and then pass it over to Intruder which would help with all the probable combinations for the correct answer.

#### Steps
1. Load the reportinator webpage and click on submit review directly. You will observe a POST request sent to https://hhc23-reportinator-dot-holidayhack2023.ue.r.appspot.com/check as below

   <img width="359" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Miragle-Hub/Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023---SANS/assets/128744976/9b70534a-2edc-4f71-af70-a0d7e33613fa">

2. Add payload marker to the value of the parameter input as below. Choose Clusterbomb attack [Check all permutation of payload combination] now fill all the 9 payload set with our combination of 0 and 1.

   <img width="506" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Miragle-Hub/Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023---SANS/assets/128744976/022888ba-fe19-4c1c-b5bd-8cab0e0021fb">

3. Lauch the attack and observe one response will have 200 response status code.

4. Now work the combination on the report and get the task completed.

Noel Boetie says "Great job on completing that challenge! Ever thought about how your newfound skills might come into play later on? Keep that mind sharp, and remember, today's victories are tomorrow's strategies!"

### Elf Hunt
Difficulty: ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„

Piney Sappington needs a lesson in JSON web tokens. Hack Elf Hunt and score 75 points.

> [!TIP]
> JWT Secrets Revealed
> 
> From: Piney Sappington
> 
> Terminal: Elf Hunt
> 
> Unlock the mysteries of JWTs with insights from PortSwigger's JWT Guide.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

This task introduces us to JWT token, how to decode/modify and work with modified token. Similar to previous tasks such as snowball fight the solution has to be worked on the same tab. There is a shortcut and an intended way to do this task. let's discuss both.



## Intended Way
1. Lauch developer console and naviagate to Apllication tab which reveals a cookie for doamin https://elfhunt.org named "ElfHunt_JWT" 
2. Copy the JWT Cookie and navigate to https://token.dev/ when decoded reveals "speed: -500". modify the speddy to -50 and copy the modified JWT token.

### Before Modifying
<img width="668" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Miragle-Hub/Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023---SANS/assets/128744976/f218cdac-14bb-4726-8635-978aa3adf9f3">

### After modifying
<img width="656" alt="image" src="https://github.com/Miragle-Hub/Holiday-Hack-Challenge-2023---SANS/assets/128744976/c71f2210-c789-46e8-b80b-60e9b6c103b4">

3. Go to developer console --> Application --> Cookies --> https://elfhunt.org.
4. Right click edit value and paste the new token.
5. Since all of this have to be done within the same tab. After modifying the token Go to developer console --> select elfhung.org and then type window.location.reload(); which will reload the iframe where hte game is loaded.

## Alternative Way

On the source code of the elf challenge we can see that there is a variable called score. If the score is 75 or higher, it updates the sessionJWT and stores it in a cookie. It pauses the game scene. So let's set the score as 80 and we win the game.
