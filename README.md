### Snowball Fight
Difficulty: ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„

Visit Christmas Island and talk to Morcel Nougat about this great new game. Team up with another player and show Morcel how to win against Santa!

To win the game we have to defeat elves and the Santa but boy is it difficult. As the hint says we need a powerful player to team with us and defeat elves and santa, that would be the Dwarf. Hint is in the Javascript source code of the game as highlighted below.

### Code Analysis:
The code appears to introduce a character (Elf the dwarf, jokingly referred to as Jared) into the game when in single-player mode.First, a sound effect named 'elf_the_dwarf_is_here' is played if audio is enabled. Next, a toast message appears on the screen saying "Elf the dwarf has joined your team!" for a short duration. Finally, a new game sprite named 'jaredSprite' is created at a specific position. All indicating we need the Dwarf.

```
 // Check if it's single-player mode
    // jared ... I mean Elf the dwarf joins the fight when in single player mode
       if (singlePlayer === 'true') {
          setTimeout(() => {
            if (isaudio) {
              gameSceneObject.sound.play('elf_the_dwarf_is_here', { volume: 0.5 });
            }
            toastManager.showToast("Elf the dwarf has joined your team!", duration=500, delay=5000);
            jaredSprite = gameSceneObject.physics.add.sprite(starting_pos.x + 150, starting_pos.y, 'jaredSprite');
```
### Working towards Victory:
